# Values

Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. The CHAOSS values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned in the course of working effectively and efficiently.

So this section is our core which reflects **how we organize ourselves**, **community guidelines**, **community ethics**, all the way down to **how we remunerate ourselves**!

Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.

**CHAOSS community** is a value-driven organization and here is what we believed in:

### üå± **Sustainability:**

Our mission is focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health. What we really mean by the ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù chaoss project is where the core contributors have a _sustainable interest_ in keeping the project going, getting others to use it, helping it to be maintained at a certain level, responding to bug reports, developing new innovations and so forth. We can‚Äôt achieve our mission unless we are sustainable in doing it. We take a broad definition of sustainability as metrics, community health, and individual sustainability in the working groups.

### \*\*\*\*üëê **Openness:**

Openness is the key to any open source project. Work in the CHAOSS Project community is primarily organized around software and metrics. Additionally, user groups provide ways to consider how software and practices can support the deployment of CHAOSS metrics. ****So following through the definition of the openness The CHAOSS community is dedicated to fostering an open and welcoming environment for contributors. Anyone can join the mailing list, participate in Zoom meetings, or contribute to any of our projects on GitHub at any time! _We strive to be open!_

### \*\*\*\*üëÅ **Transparency:**

Being transparent about as many things as possible is an aim for the open source ecosystem. By making information public, we reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. We appreciate the use of public issue trackers, projects, and repositories on GitHub when possible.

We make information public by default because transparency is one of our values. However, it is most important to focus on better and healthy outcomes Therefore, a category of information is **public** unless there is a reason for it not to be. We have CHAOSS community calls and working group meetings every week and we welcome everyone, who is not only within the core team but also who has keen interests to participate and support our structure. 

When information is not public, it may also be treated as limited access, only shared with certain CHAOSS community members.

### üåê Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

 Diversity, inclusion, and belonging are fundamental to the success of CHAOSS community. We aim to make a significant impact on our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We have designed a multidimensional approach to ensure that CHAOSS community is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build and institutionalize a culture that is inclusive and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We have people participating in our community calls globally and we encourage participation in a diverse set of countries. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and nationalities in our community and company.
