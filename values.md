# Values

Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. The CHAOSS values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned in the course of working effectively and efficiently.

So this section is our core which reflects **how we organize ourselves**, **community guidelines**, **community ethics**, all the way down to **how we invest in ourselves**!

Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.

**CHAOSS community** is a value-driven organization and here is what we believed in:

## üå± **Sustainability:**

Our goal is focused on creating software and metrics to help define community health. What we really mean by the ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù CHAOSS community is where people have a _sustainable interest_ in keeping the project going, helping others to participate, responding to community challenges, developing new innovations, and so forth. We can‚Äôt achieve these things without the help of everyone, creating sustainability for our metrics, software, and people in the working groups.

## üëê **Openness:**

Openness is the key to any open source project. Work in the CHAOSS community is primarily organized around software and metrics. Additionally, user groups provide ways to consider how software and practices can support the deployment of CHAOSS metrics. Following through the definition of the openness The CHAOSS community is dedicated to fostering an open and welcoming environment for all people. Anyone can join the mailing list, participate in Zoom meetings, or contribute to any of our projects on GitHub at any time! _We strive to be open!_

## üëÅ **Transparency:**

Being transparent about as many things as possible is an aim for the open source ecosystem. By making information public, we reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. We appreciate the use of public issue trackers, projects, and repositories on GitHub when possible.

We make information public by default because transparency is one of our values. As such, a large category of CHAOSS information is **public** unless there is a reason for it not to be. We have CHAOSS community calls and working group meetings every week and we welcome everyone, who is not only within the core team but also who has keen interests to participate and support our structure.

When information is not public, it may also be treated as limited access, only shared with certain CHAOSS community members.

## üåê Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

Diversity, inclusion, and belonging are fundamental to the success of CHAOSS community. We aim to make a significant impact on our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We take a positive approach to ensure that the CHAOSS community is a place where **all people** can belong and contribute. We actively reflect on a culture that is inclusive and supports everyone equally in the process of achieving their goals. We continually work to welcome and support everyone in our community.

## üèÅ Consistency

We show up every day, do our jobs, and hit the ground running. We are consistent with over time with metric and software development which helps us to maintain the momentum of the project and the improvements within that. Consistency requires the following things:

* **Commitment**. We are dependable, reliable, and responsible for our decisions and actions every single day. We‚Äôre committed to long-term success and we prefer not taking shortcuts.
* **Empowerment**. We encourage to build skills and habits that help us focus on our goals.
* **Mindfulness**. We prefer momentum while remembering our mission and vision. We encourage regular feedback and prefer learning from any mistakes.

## üòé Merit

We are persistent in maintaining community health by providing ways for the external communities and projects to use metrics and software developed. With the homogeneous support of people around, we are growing and people have good sayings in promoting our brand by spreading the word because they have believed and realized our level of deliverability in terms of metrics and community.

## ü§ó Trust

Earning trust in an open source community is equally important as being transparent. We have demonstrated our expertise in various subject matters which is focused on community health. We stabilize in maintaining the good community bonds, the safety of privacy issues as a result people feel safe contributing to our core and connected to our project at a personal level.

## Utility

Work in the CHAOSS Project community is largely organized around software and metrics. Additionally, user groups provide ways to consider how software and practices can support the deployment of CHAOSS metrics.

Many other projects and communities have been utilizing the CHAOSS work to measure the health of community which means that our metrics are useful and actually helps in improving the open source community health for projects.
