description: Maintaining, Reviewing and Updating Released Metrics

# Revising Existing Metrics:
1. As our process for developing metrics evolves, we will implement a process to go back to old metrics and review every two years. Specifically, after 4 release cycles, we should review metrics and see whether they are still aligned with 
   - Our current metric structure, 
   - Our current metric style, and 
   - The original intention of the metric, and if so, whether the metric's language and/or intention requires updating. 
2. What Types of Changes are suitable for continuous release?
 - Whenever there is a language or terminology change that would affect other metric references. 
 - Changing the name of a metric (in any way)
 - Any changes that go beyond grammar or spelling fixes in the sections: 
   - Question
   - Definition
   - Objectives
   - Implementation
3. Types of metric changes that do not require review:
 - Grammar or spelling fixes (not including metric name)
 - Updates to sections References and Contributors
 - Ultimately, we need a gardener who ensures consistency and flags metrics that need to be “updated”.
