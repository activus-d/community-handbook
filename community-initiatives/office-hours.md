# Guide to Hosting Office Hours via Zoom

## Background
The term “office hours” comes from the academic setting. It’s used to indicate a period of time in which the professor or instructor is present in their office and openly available for questions. No appointment is needed, and students can come and go at any time during that period.

We have adopted our own version of “office hours” and host bi-weekly blocks of time in which people can come and go via our Zoom channel to ask questions or meet community members. 

The concept of “office hours” is helpful for newcomers who may not feel like asking questions in a larger group, and who would feel more comfortable in a one-on-one setting while learning about CHAOSS.

## Eligibility for Hosting Office Hours
Anyone in the community is eligible to host an Office Hours session, but we appreciate a general knowledge of and past participation in the CHAOSS project. Because you will be responsible for representing someone’s first impression of CHAOSS, it’s important that you are able to answer questions in a knowledgeable way (or at least have an idea of where to find the answer if you aren’t sure).

## Steps for Hosting

1. The signup for hosting a block of time is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cMBPSaQYSh0ibIBBbYufvDeTsa7ddDKic1f4QpEr2U4/edit#gid=0). You can add your name in any open time slot. You may want to add this to your calendar so you don’t forget :)
2. A few days before your scheduled hosting time, check in with the Community Manager (currently [Elizabeth Barron](mailto:elizabeth@naramore.net)). 
We use our regular dedicated community Zoom channel for hosting Office Hours (https://zoom.us/my/chaoss). 
You will need to get the login and password for the CHAOSS Community account, so you have the proper permissions to be a host.
3. On the day of your scheduled hosting time, log in to the CHAOSS Community Zoom account and click on “New Meeting” to start the Zoom call. 
4. Keep note of how many people enter the Zoom call while you’re hosting and what kinds of questions they ask. We keep track of these to improve our documentation and to identify other areas that need clarification for newcomers. 
5. When the block of time is over, click “End Meeting” to end the session.
6. Update the [signup spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cMBPSaQYSh0ibIBBbYufvDeTsa7ddDKic1f4QpEr2U4/edit#gid=0) with the number of attendees and add any themes to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMtrUAN9q8rvsNUs3LmCyN3lFXQ-_uE-4LLBprufrLc/edit).

## Tips for Hosting

1. It’s nice to have your camera on during the call, so people can see a friendly face when they join.
2. If there is no one in the call, you can do other work. You do not need to stare at the empty Zoom call. :) 
3. If you want to minimize the Zoom window when the call is empty, it’s helpful to turn on notifications for when people join/leave the call. You can do this by clicking “Participants” at the bottom of the screen. At the bottom of the pop-out window, click on “More” then “Play Sound When Someone Joins/Leaves”
4. Remember to be friendly and welcoming, as this may be the person’s first impression of CHAOSS. You are representing the entire CHAOSS community with your interactions, and our Code of Conduct is always in full effect.
5. We widely publish our Zoom link, and this is to make it more accessible to anyone who wants to join. But because this is openly published, and although it rarely happens, someone may enter simply to troll or have less than honest intentions. You can remove anyone who violates our Code of Conduct by clicking “Participants”, then hover over the person’s name. Then click “More” to see the option to Remove participant. They will not be able to rejoin. 
6. If you are uncertain about hosting and want to do some testing of the Zoom interface with the Community Manager prior to your scheduled hosting time, this is absolutely an option! Just let them know.
7. More information about the Zoom Admin controls can be found on the [Zoom Support Site](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005759423-Managing-Participants-in-a-Meeting).
8. You do not need to record or publish the Office Hours Zoom calls.
