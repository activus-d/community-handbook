# CHAOSS Meetings



CHAOSS works a lot in meetings -- synchronous video calls

1. We have meeting in Zoom and record in Zoom
2. We announce at the beginning of each meeting that we're recording the meeting
3. Recordings are automatically uploaded to YouTube as private 



After our meetings, somone needs to publish the recordings on YouTube

1. Update video name
2. Add description that includes link to the minutes document and archive in Governance repo
3. Configure thumbnail image to show on YouTube for video \([Export PNG from this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18iRLlqSfZK_36S0pqACJ0i32BWbu01aXXLdtU1Op__M/edit#slide=id.p3)\)
4. Add video to appropriate YouTube playlist
5. Publish video
6. Update meeting minutes by pasting the link to the video there
