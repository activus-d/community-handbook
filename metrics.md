# Metrics

### CHAOSS Metrics Committee

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. The CHAOSS Metrics Committee's goals are to establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.

#### All the metrics are released within the "[**Release History**](https://chaoss.community/release-history/)" page on the CHAOSS website
