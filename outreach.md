Spreading the word about what is going on in CHAOSS community is a vital part of CHAOSS engagement, and below are the following ways with which you can get involved in growing the CHAOSS community

* **Writing Blogs** - Blog posts help in reaching a better audience and generating their interests. We value the time and efforts of our readers, so keep your blog posts more focused and straight forward around your goals which you want to deliver. The CHAOSS website has a section of [**Blog Post**](https://chaoss.community/blog/) where all the blogs written under the CHAOSS community are hosted but we don't want to limit you to the CHAOSS website. You can use any platform for writing your blogs.
* **Social Media** - You can help us spread the word by sharing about CHAOSS on social handles. The CHAOSS has its account on Twitter and you can tag with the username as [**@CHAOSSproj**](https://twitter.com/CHAOSSproj)\*\*\*\*
