# Outreach

 The **CHAOSS** project was officially announced at the **Open Source Summit North America** 2017 in Los Angeles. Here is a picture of the workshop participants at OSSNA2017 -- the first to help us spread CHAOSS! If you are interested in helping spread CHAOSS now, check out the following ways to get involved with the CHAOSS

Spreading the word about what is going on in the CHAOSS community is a vital part of CHAOSS engagement, and below are the following ways with which you can get involved in growing the CHAOSS community

* **Writing Blogs** - Blog posts help in reaching a better audience and generating their interests. We value the time and efforts of our readers, so keep your blog posts more focused and straight forward around your goals which you want to deliver. The CHAOSS website has a section of [**Blog Post**](https://chaoss.community/blog/) where all the blogs written under the CHAOSS community are hosted but we don't want to limit you to the CHAOSS website. You can use any platform for writing your blogs.
* **Social Media** - You can help us spread the word by sharing about CHAOSS on social handles. The CHAOSS has its account on Twitter and you can tag with the username as [**@CHAOSSproj**](https://twitter.com/CHAOSSproj)\*\*\*\*
* **Merchandise -** If you are good at designing then you can help us in designing and processing the t-shirts, stickers, posters, badges, and similar. You can checkout [**CHAOSS design principles**](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/design) to understand the design better. 
* **Organize Conferences and Meetups** - We generally have CHAOSScon every year. So if you are good at organizing and strategizing the events then check it out the [**role and responsibilities**](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/roles-and-responsibilities#chaosscon-organizing-committee-member) of the  CHAOSScon organizing members and get involved with the team. We always appreciate in organizing local meetups and events. 

### How and where to communicate for respective engagements?

We generally prefer to communicate through **the CHAOSS mailing** list \(**chaoss@linuxfoundation.org**\) but sometimes there are specific leads for initiatives inside. You can also try reaching any core member for better clarity.
