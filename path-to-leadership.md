# Path to Leadership

### What leadership means to the CHAOSS community?

The LeaderüèÖis someone who has specific decision-making power over some part of a group and thus additional accountability and can help in grooming, prioritizing, and planning.

### Why is leadership important to us?

We are a volunteer-drivenüë•organization which means the work within the CHAOSS is focused around the creation of metrics and software which entirely depends upon the contributions made by external individuals and communities. We need someone to direct the vision of **creation**, **planning**, and **architecture** of new initiatives within the community n order to drive through the better objectives.
