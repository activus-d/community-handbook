# Design Worklfow

### Our Process

We follow a 4-query procedure to solve the design issues. Each question is a step toward the completion of the product.

* **What do we want?** We need to initiate the requirement goals that define - what are we trying to achieve? How will it impact the CHAOSS community? 
* **What do we have?** We need to take into consideration the information we have - Do we have any set of design guidelines or information for the specific new goal that we are trying to achieve? 
* **How do we get what we want?** We need solid ideation in order to achieve any goal - Does the community agrees to follow the new goal? Do we have any plans or processes to achieve the new design goal? 
* **What will happen when we do?** We need to understand the future impact for any specific design goal - Is the problem solved? Is this what you were looking forward to having? Will it create a better impact on the CHAOSS community?
