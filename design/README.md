### What is CHAOSS design? ðŸ–Œ 

As the community is being mobilized, and it fosters around **Community Health Analytics Open Source Software** so all its members participate in the choices about what action to undertake in design and provide better user experience, it becomes useful to combine those choices and decisions and lay some guidelines. Designers use such guidelines to judge how to adopt principles such as intuitiveness, learnability, efficiency, and consistency so they can create compelling designs and meet and exceed user needs.

Hence, CHAOSS design is a place where we solve design principle issues and improve the design structure of the community projects

### What are we trying to achieve? ðŸ¤”

* Improve better user experience and provide high-quality design solutions.
