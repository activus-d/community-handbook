## About Google Season of Docs ![](../.gitbook/assets/seasonofdocs_icon_grey_300ppi-whitespace-cropped.png) 

The goal of Season of Docs is to provide a framework for technical writers and open source projects to work together towards the common goal of improving an open-source project's documentation.

During the program, technical writers spend a few months working closely with an open source community. They bring their technical writing expertise to the project's documentation, and at the same time learn about the open-source project and new technologies.

The open-source projects work with the technical writers to improve the project's documentation and processes. Together they may choose to build a new documentation set, or redesign the existing docs, or improve and document the open-source community's contribution procedures and onboarding experience.
