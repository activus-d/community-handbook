# CHAOSS History

### Evolution of CHAOSS at Open Source Sumit North America

There was a meeting at the Linux Foundation Leadership Summit which is now known as the member summit. It started from the whiteboard in the room where some groups of people planned to talk about community health. There were many interests from the people and there were folks from the Open Source program Office and different foundations. Concluding through the community health discussions, it leads to the evolution of CHAOSS at Open Source Summit North America 2017

### Bitergia extends its hands to help CHAOSS during their origin

Bitergia was formed in 2012 by a group of folks who were researching around community metric system and health. So Bitergia came forward to support the CHAOSS by providing various insights and metrics including a project\(GrimoireLab\) which they thought about donating or moving under the Linux Foundation. So after making fair research around metrics and the toolsets which could support the vision, it was decided to get these together and build the academics to study this phenomenal and formalize it whereas Bitergia on the other hand has the tools, providing professional services around The Linux Foundation. So all got together to participate in this project and worked several weeks and months on establishing it. Later the Grimoirlab became part of the CHAOSS community.

### Linux Foundation involvement during the CHAOSS evolution

Some folks present at Open Source Summit North America from the Linux Foundation were keen to measure the community health issues and they started with the discussions of needing the metric mechanism, talking with various folks. It was not expected that someone would join the other people to discuss this topic but there were huge interests and folks after collaborating started with the CHAOSS as a Linux Foundation project.
