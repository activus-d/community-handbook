# Roadmap

This roadmap is our strategic plan that defines our goal or desired outcome and includes the major milestones that are needed to reach it.

### Metrics

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities' health and sustainability. The CHAOSS Metrics Committee's goals are to establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.

### Metric Releases

The Working Groups within the CHAOSS are focused on releasing new metrics where metrics are identified and defined using a continuous contribution process. The metrics are officially released biannually following a 30 day comment period.
