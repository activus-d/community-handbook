## About Google Summer of Code ![](../.gitbook/assets/1200px-gsoc-icon.svg.png) 

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open-source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school. 

Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over. The amount of the stipend depends on the [**purchasing power parity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) of the country where the student's university is located. Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though students can also propose their own project ideas.
